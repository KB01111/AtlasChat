# AtlasChat Production Deployment Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for deploying AtlasChat to production.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Create production `.env` file with secure values
- [ ] Generate strong JWT secret key
- [ ] Configure database connection strings
- [ ] Set up E2B API key
- [ ] Configure CORS settings for production domains

### Security Verification
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints require authentication
- [ ] Ensure rate limiting is properly configured
- [ ] Confirm input validation is implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] Verify file path validation prevents directory traversal
- [ ] Check code execution sandbox security measures

### Database Setup
- [ ] Run database migrations on production database
- [ ] Create initial admin user
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Configure connection pooling

### Testing
- [ ] Run all integration tests
- [ ] Perform manual testing of critical flows
- [ ] Verify frontend-backend integration
- [ ] Test code execution functionality
- [ ] Validate authentication flow

## Deployment Steps

### Backend Deployment
1. Build the backend Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t atlaschat-backend:prod -f backend/Dockerfile .
   ```

2. Push the image to your container registry:
   ```bash
   docker tag atlaschat-backend:prod your-registry/atlaschat-backend:prod
   docker push your-registry/atlaschat-backend:prod
   ```

### Frontend Deployment
1. Build the frontend Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t atlaschat-frontend:prod -f frontend/Dockerfile .
   ```

2. Push the image to your container registry:
   ```bash
   docker tag atlaschat-frontend:prod your-registry/atlaschat-frontend:prod
   docker push your-registry/atlaschat-frontend:prod
   ```

### Infrastructure Setup
1. Provision required infrastructure:
   - Virtual machines or Kubernetes cluster
   - Managed databases (PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Qdrant)
   - Load balancer
   - SSL certificates

2. Configure DNS:
   - Set up domain names for frontend and backend
   - Configure DNS records

3. Set up SSL:
   - Obtain SSL certificates
   - Configure HTTPS for all services

### Deployment
1. Deploy using Docker Compose or Kubernetes:
   - For Docker Compose:
     ```bash
     docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
     ```
   - For Kubernetes:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
     ```

2. Verify deployment:
   - Check all services are running
   - Verify health endpoints
   - Test authentication
   - Test basic functionality

## Post-Deployment Checklist

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Configure log aggregation
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Create alerts for critical errors
- [ ] Implement uptime monitoring

### Backup Configuration
- [ ] Verify database backups are working
- [ ] Set up automated backup schedule
- [ ] Test backup restoration process

### Security Auditing
- [ ] Perform security scan of deployed services
- [ ] Check for exposed ports or endpoints
- [ ] Verify all communications use HTTPS
- [ ] Confirm proper authentication for all services

### Documentation
- [ ] Update documentation with production URLs
- [ ] Document deployment architecture
- [ ] Create runbook for common operations
- [ ] Document backup and recovery procedures

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- [ ] Configure backend to scale horizontally
- [ ] Set up load balancing
- [ ] Implement session persistence if needed

### Database Scaling
- [ ] Configure database read replicas
- [ ] Set up connection pooling
- [ ] Implement query optimization

### Monitoring and Alerts
- [ ] Set up alerts for high resource usage
- [ ] Configure auto-scaling triggers
- [ ] Monitor database performance

## Rollback Plan

In case of deployment issues:

1. Identify the problem:
   - Check logs for errors
   - Verify service health
   - Test critical functionality

2. Decide on rollback strategy:
   - For minor issues: Fix and redeploy
   - For major issues: Roll back to previous version

3. Execute rollback:
   - For Docker Compose:
     ```bash
     docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
     docker-compose -f docker-compose.prev.yml up -d
     ```
   - For Kubernetes:
     ```bash
     kubectl rollout undo deployment/atlaschat-backend
     kubectl rollout undo deployment/atlaschat-frontend
     ```

4. Verify rollback:
   - Check service health
   - Test critical functionality
   - Monitor for any issues

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Updates
1. Build and test new versions in staging environment
2. Deploy to production during low-traffic periods
3. Monitor closely after deployment

### Database Maintenance
1. Schedule regular database backups
2. Perform index optimization
3. Monitor database growth and performance

### Security Updates
1. Regularly update dependencies
2. Apply security patches promptly
3. Conduct periodic security audits
